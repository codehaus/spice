            <p>This describes a simple example of a Policy descriptor.
            Let us assume that
            <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/phoenix">Phoenix</a>
            has been integrated with the Policy toolkit and that the snippet
            defining classloader is included in the deployment format of
            Phoenix (the .sar file).</p>
            <p>The format below should be largely self explanatory if you
            are familiar with the java.policy file format. One thing that
            is worth mentioning is that the example uses codebases with a
            protocol of "sar:". This is a protocol specific to Phoenix and
            makes it possible to refer to jars and classes contained within
            the deployment archive.</p>
