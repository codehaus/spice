/**
 * Abstract implementation of {@link ConnectionManager}.
 *
 * <p>A sample of configuration parameters for the component are given below. Note that on some OS/JVM
 * combinations <tt>soTimeout</tt> must be set to non-0 value or else the ServerSocket will
 * never get out of accept() system call and we wont be able to shutdown the server
 * socket properly. However it can introduce performance problems if constantly
 * timing out. <tt>shutdownTimeout</tt> indicates how long we should wait to see if
 * incoming connections will shutdown gracefully when asked. If they dont shutdown
 * gracefully and <tt>forceShutdown</tt> is true then the connection will be forced
 * to be shutdown if the user asked for connection to be "tearedDown".</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>soTimeout=500 -- 500 ms timeouts on Server Sockets --</li>
 *  <li>forceShutdown=true -- forcefully shutdown connections if they don't shutdown gracefully --</li>
 *  <li>shutdownTimeout=200 -- wait 200ms for connections to gracefully shutdown --</li>
 * </ul>
