            This component allows you to parse Command Line Options
            during application start-up.  It is designed to parse the
            command line options in the same manner as the C getopt()
            function in glibc (the GNU C runtime library). It attempts
            to do this in a simpler, more Java-centric manner than the
            original product.

            There are a number of examples in the examples/ directory
            of this release. These examples allow you to get started
            fast and easy.  See the examples/README.txt file for
            further details.

        <section name="Parsing Rules">
            <p>
            The command line is parsed according to the following rules. There are
            two forms of options in this package, the Long form and the Short form.
            The long form of an option is preceded by the '--' characters while the
            short form is preceded by a single '-'. Some example options would be;
            "--an-option", "-a", "--day", "-s -f -a".
            </p>
            <p>
            In the tradition of UNIX programs, the short form of an option can occur
            immediately after another short form option. So if 'a', 'b' and 'c' are
            short forms of options that take no parameters then the following
            command lines are equivalent: "-abc", "-a -bc", "-a -b -c", "-ab -c", etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            Options can also accept arguments if specified. You can specify that an
            option requires an argument in which the text immediately following the
            option will be considered to be an argument to the option. So if 'a' was an
            option that required an argument then the following would be equivalent;
            "-abc", "-a bc" (namely the option 'a' with argument 'bc').
            </p>
            <p>
            Options can also specify optional arguments. In this case if there is any
            text immediately following the option character then it is considered an
            argument.  Otherwise, the option has no arguments. For example if 'a' was an
            option that required an optional argument then "-abc" is an option 'a' with
            argument "bc" while "-a bc" is an option 'a' with no argument, followed by
            the text "bc". </p>
            <p>It is also possible to place an '=' sign between the option
            and it's argument. So if we assume that a is an option that
            requires an argument then the following are all equivalent;
            "-a=bc", "-a bc" "-abc".
            </p>
            <p>
            In some cases it is also necessary to disable command line parsing so that you
            can pass a text argument to the program that starts with a '-' character. To do
            this insert the sequence '--' onto the command line with no text immediately
            following it. This will disable processing for the rest of the command line.
            The '--' characters will not be passed to the user program. For instance the
            line "-- -b" would result in the program being passed the
            text "-b" (ie. not as an option).
