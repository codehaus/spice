                Jervlet is a component wrapper for servlet containers. It allows you to treat your
                favorite servlet engine as a component in your container of choice, as well as treat
                your servlets as components too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jervlet currently supports the Jetty servlet container, and provides integration
                with Avalon, DNA and Picocontainer frameworks. The architecture follows the
                Inversion of Control (IoC) pattern and allows easy extension and adaptability to
                other frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jervlet's target audience is developers that want to simplify the integration of
                servlets into their systems, and allow servlets to participate in the dependency
                resolution and lifecycle that your component framework provides.
            </p>
