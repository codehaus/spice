		<p>LoggerStore is a component for storing an Avalon Logger hierarchy,
		abstracting the underlying logger implementation and configuration mechanism.
		LoggerStore currently supports three different logging implementations:
		<ul>
			<li>Avalon LogKit</li>
			<li>Jakarta Log4J</li>
			<li>Sun JDK 1.4 logging (java.util.logging)</li>
	    </ul>
		The Avalon Logger interface provides a high-level abstraction which 
		supports COP (Component Oriented Programming) - 
		see the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org">Avalon Project</a> for more details.
		</p>
		<p>LoggerStore is an interface with concrete implementations for each of
		the underlying logging systems.  The interface has the following methods:
		<source>		
Logger getLogger() throws Exception;

Logger getLogger( final String categoryName ) throws Exception;

void close();
		</source>
 		The first two methods allow the user to retrieve the root Logger and the
 		Logger for a given logging category.  Whenever an application has finished 
 		using the LoggerStore it will call the close() method indicating that the
 		logger hierarchy should also be shutdown.
		</p> 
 	 </section>
 	 <section name="LoggerStoreFactory">        
		<p>Each LoggerStore has one or more associated LoggerStoreFactory which also
		acts as a configurator for the Logger:
		<source>		
LoggerStore createLoggerStore( Map config ) throws Exception;
		</source>		
		where the Map contains the parameters for the configuration of the store.

	  	<p>There are several ways to configure the LoggerStore.
