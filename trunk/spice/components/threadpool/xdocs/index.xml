            ThreadPool is a utility component that provides the user with ability to
            pool threads. The toolkit also provides easy mechanisms for users to
            customize the thread environment before and after it executes the work
            on the pooled threads.

         <p>
            ThreadPool implementations are designed to support deployment in different
            containers or frameworks, while honouring the same API.
