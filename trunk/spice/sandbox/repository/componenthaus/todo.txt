 * take version number from maven pom.  No, not the maven pom.  Let the user worry about how to get the version id to the Ant task.
 * take dependency jars from maven pom. No, not the maven pom.  Let the user worry about how to get the author names to the Ant task.
 * Federation
 * Live XPath query/reporting of component model
 * Acceptable UI - gulp!
 * Console on the top of each page, displaying result of last significant action (use monitor and tiles) (similar to cvs console in IDEA).
 * Add Submit date to component
 * Access control (for write actions)
 * Users and user management
 * Rework the component details page.  Yes, link to impls, but display what a user has to do to use the impl
 * JMX integration into the heart of the app
 * Investigate Beanshell integration, for debugging problems while live
 * Fix search query - its only using the first word
 * Restarted prevayler is not loading objects correctly - all the string fields are "gone".
 * Disable multiple submissions of the same component.
 * Structured API Search (Find me all methods taking a java.io.File and returning a java.lang.String, and importing java.sql classes)
 * If the component is a class, show only its methods, to better convey the service offering.
 * Consider providing a means of displaying test cases that use a particular service method.  Excellent way to convey purpose and usage of the service method.

Done

November 5th
 * Stop including plug-interfaces in the repository as public interfaces.  Allow the submitter decide whats public.
 * Support multiple components in a single source tree (same jar I guess).
 * Allow the service interface to be a class (was limiting to interfaces up to this point, but thats too limiting)

November 2nd
 * More test cases for search stuff

October 26th
 * TDD'ed re-write of the submission stuff
 * XStream replaces Betwixt

October 16th
 * aspico integration, so we can have type 3 IoC.  Forget aspico - make a pico-style spring beanfactory.

October 15th
 * Pico plugin done.  Controllers and beans need to be ported to type 3 still.

October 5th
 * fix search engine indexing problem - last component only indexed
