                MetaClass supports runtime access to metadata associated with program elements
                or artefacts. The program elements include packages, classes, methods and fields
                and each metadata element is referred to as an attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attributes are usually specified in the java source files as javadoc
                markup. The source file is then processed and the metadata is compiled into
                descriptors that MetaClass is capable of reading. These descriptors are then
                loaded at runtime to provide metadata about the program elements.
