                MetaClass supports runtime access to metadata associated with program elements
                or artefacts. The program elements include packages, classes, methods and fields
                and each metadata element is referred to as an attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attributes are usually specified in the java source files as javadoc
                markup. The source file is then processed and the metadata is compiled into
                descriptors that MetaClass is capable of reading. These descriptors are then
                loaded at runtime to provide metadata about the program elements.
            </p>

        <section name="Getting Started">
            <p>
                To get started using MetaClass the developer should first look at the
                <a href="model.html">Attribute Model</a> description to see what type
                of metadata is stored by MetaClass. The developer then needs to markup
                classes and <a href="precompile.html">pre-compile</a> the attribute
                metadata before they can access the metadata at
                <a href="runtime.html">runtime</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the developer has mastered the common uses-cases of MetaClass they
                can move on to more advanced usages such as
                <a href="interception.html">filtering and augmenting</a> metadata
                during the pre-compilation stage, loading the metadata from
                <a href="accessor.html">alternative sources</a> and
                <a href="integration.html">integrating</a> MetaClass into a java container.
