                 Component Model for Avalon Framework

One of the more important parts of our evolution is the definition of a more
complete component model. This means we need to be able to define the operational
requirements of a component and the resources/capabilities that the component
is capable of providing to other components.

This component model should be restricted to areas that are already well explored
within the context of Avalon components and it should also be capable of modelling
the requirements of existing container systems.
