                     Roadmap for development of 
                        Avalon Framework

In this document I attempt to outline a future direction for Avalon.
There is little doubt that there are issues that need to be addressed
within Avalon. 

Many solutions have been proposed and many discussions have been initiated. 
At this stage it has mainly been pie in the sky talks that while idealistic 
lack practical aspects that make them viable paths of evolution.

One thing I really want to avoid is repeating the same mistakes that we have 
committed in the past. In particular all this talk about a single container
makes me somewhat nervous. It has been tried before in the past and IMHO the
issues have not become sufficiently clear that we are certain to avoid the 
problems of the past. Essentially it comes down to how do we provide the 
flexability that is required by all interested parties without making the 
container overly complex, buggy and painful to maintain. For a better 
explanation of the issues you may want to read an interview with Martin 
Fowler [1]  who recently discussed some similar issues.
