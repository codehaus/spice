                 Metadata for Avalon Framework

There has been a demonstrated need to add metadata about various artefacts
in Avalon for a long time. Historically we have had strongly typed meta-data


The physical form of the metadata is not that important - whether the metadata
is extracted from xml, binary or some type of runtime attribute metadata is 
irrelevent. Different systems are likely to have different requirements (ie
J2ME will likely use binary metadata for speed/memory advantages but something 
like Phoenix will probably continue to use XML descriptors).
