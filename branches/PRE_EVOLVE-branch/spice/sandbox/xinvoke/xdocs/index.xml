      XInvoke is a high performance implementation of the "Interceptor"
      pattern for method invocations. Essentially this means that this
      toolkit allows you to "intercept" a method invocation and perform
      operations before and after an invocation or even to directly handle
      the method invocation. The objects that implement this interception are
      called <a href="apidocs/org/realityforge/xinvoke/Interceptor.html">
      Interceptors</a> and usually there is a series of interceptors through
      which a method invocation will pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XInvoke framework only supports interception of methods defined by a
      interface. It was found that this satisfied the majority of use cases in
      component architectures and it was easy to implement with the advent of
      java.lang.reflect.Proxy in JDK 1.3.
