* Add in Javadoc for all classes, and all methods

* Consider using a new extension that is a little more logical. Maybe -meta.binary, -meta.xml, -meta.ser ?

* Consider storing attributes for packages in a file such as com/biz/package.mad for the com.biz
  package. ("package" is a reserved word so no class can be named this and thus the above should
  not cause conflicts). It would be accessed via something like
final Package pkg = Package.getPackage("com.biz");
final Attribute[] attributes = Attributes.getAttributes(pkg);
final Attribute attribute = Attributes.getAttribute(pkg,"busobj.desc");
