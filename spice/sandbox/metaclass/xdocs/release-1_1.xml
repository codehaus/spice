            <p>
                This is the second release of MetaClass. This release
                introduces several refactorings to simplify usage of
                MetaClass in response to user feedback. See the
                changes below for a comprehensive list of changes in
                the release. The release can be downloaded from;

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Removed the notion of Package-level attributes
                    and corresponding PackageDescriptor. This was removed
                    as there was no actual mechanism to compile package
                    attributes. There was also ambiguity wrt how to handle
                    package attributes. See the
                    <a href="faq.html#Package%20Attributes">FAQ</a> for more
                    details.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed a bug where methods with the same name and the
                    same number of parameters would always return the first
                    methods attributes. This bug was also fixed for
                    constructors that had the same number of parameters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moved the following classes into the package
                    <tt>org.realityforge.metaclass.introspector</tt> so that
                    now all the packages have clean dependency lines and there
                    is no circular dependencies. The classes moved included;
                    <tt>org.realityforge.metaclass.MetaClassIntrospector</tt>,
                    <tt>org.realityforge.metaclass.MetaClassException</tt>,
                    <tt>org.realityforge.metaclass.io.DefaultMetaClassAccessor</tt>
                    and <tt>org.realityforge.metaclass.io.MetaClassAccessor</tt>.
