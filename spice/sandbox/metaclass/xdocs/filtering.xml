                MetaClass provides mechanisms via which users can selectively
                filter out JavaClass objects so that they will not be processed
                to produce MetaClass metadata files.

            <p>
                All filters implement the
                <tt>org.realityforge.metaclass.tools.tasks.JavaClassFilter</tt>
                interface. Consider the situation where a developer only wants to
                process JavaClass objects that have the doclet tag "@dna.component"
                declared at the class level. All other classes should be skipped
                as they are not used by the application and only increase the size
                of the generated metadata. The following source code performs
                that filtering.
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
public class NonDNAComponentFilter
    implements JavaClassFilter
{
    public JavaClass filterClass( JavaClass javaClass )
    {
        if( null != javaClass.getTagByName( "dna.component" ) )
        {
            return javaClass;
        }
        else
        {
            return null;
        }
    }
}

        <section name="Using the Filter">
            <p>
                After the developer has written the filter they have to
                get the ant task to use the interceptor. This is done by adding
                a child element &lt;filter/&gt; into the task. This element
                has one attribute indicating the name of the filter class
                to use and contains a child &lt;classpath/&gt; element that defines
                where the .class files for filter are loaded from. See below
                for an example of how to use the above filter. Any number of
                Filters can be added and each filter will be invoked
                in turn until one returns null or until there are no
                more filter left.
