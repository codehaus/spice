 * aspico integration, so we can have type 3 IoC.  Forget aspico - make a pico-style spring beanfactory.
 * test cases, before we get out of control
 * take version number from maven pom
 * take dependency jars from maven pom
 * better search results page
 * Federation
 * Live XPath query/reporting of component model
 * Acceptable UI - gulp!
 * Console on each page, displaying result of last significant action (use monitor and tiles)
 * Add Submit date to component
 * Access control (for write actions)
 * Users and user management
 * Support multiple components in a single source tree (same jar I guess).
 * Rework the component details page.  Yes, link to impls, but display what a user has to do to use the impl
 * JMX integration into the heart of the app
 * Investigate Beanshell integration, for debugging problems while live
