/**
 * The <code>Container</code> interface represents a servlet container.
 * In Jervlet the container has only two functions, to create and
 * destroy <code>ContextHandler</code>s. The context handlers are used
 * to manage <code>Context</code>s.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The idea behind this interface, or functionality, is to shield web
 * applications from other components using the same container
 * (read web server). A context can only be managed through the
 * <code>ContextManager</code> that created it.
 * <br/><br/>
 * A container implementation representing an HTTP server/servlet container
 * would normally implement the <code>Container</code> and
 * <code>ListenerHandler</code> interfaces. In a system where all
 * components can access all contexts noting says that the container
 * implementation can't directly implement <code>ContextHandler</code> too,
 * for an unshielded context manager.
