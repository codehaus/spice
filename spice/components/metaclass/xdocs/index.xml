			<p>MetaClass provides runtime access to attributes specified in javadoc format.</p>
		
			<p>There are two steps involved: pre-runtime generation and runtime retrieval.</p>
	  </section>
		
	  <section name="Generation">
			<p>Generation is done with ant (refer run.xml).  There exists an ant task called MetaGenerateTask
		that must be <code>taskdef</code> ed into your xml file, which is then run over .class
		files to produce .mad (metaclass data) files.  It can be run in paired or non-paired mode.</p>
		
			<p>In paired mode the .mad files are created in the same directory as the .class files.  This is
		the default mode.</p>
		
			<p>In non-paired mode all .mad files are created in the specified directory and named with
		dot-delimited full package structure.  This is enabled by passing <code>dest="${specified-directory}"</code> to
		the metagenerate task.</p>
