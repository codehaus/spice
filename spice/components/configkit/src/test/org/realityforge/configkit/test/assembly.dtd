<!--
The assembly is the document root, it defines:

block           a block that exists in the application
block-listener  a listener that exists in the application
-->
<!ELEMENT assembly (block|block-listener|listener)*>
<!ATTLIST assembly id ID #IMPLIED >

<!--
The block element declares a block exists in the application.
The element defines:

name            the name of a block
class           the class of block instance

provide         declare that particular blocks that will provide
                the block with particular services
proxy           TODO:description
-->
<!ELEMENT block (provide*,proxy?)>
  <!ATTLIST block class CDATA #REQUIRED>
  <!ATTLIST block name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
The provide element declares that a specific service is provided to the block
by another block. The provide element defines:

role    the name of the service that is being provided (aka the role of service)
name    the name of the block that will provide service
alias   the alias of the block when it is placed in a Map dependency (may not need to be specified).

<!ELEMENT provide EMPTY>
  <!ATTLIST provide role CDATA #REQUIRED>
  <!ATTLIST provide name CDATA #REQUIRED>
  <!ATTLIST provide alias CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
This indicates whether the block should be proxied.

disable set this to true to disable proxying of the block implementation
-->
<!ELEMENT proxy EMPTY>
  <!ATTLIST proxy disable CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
The block element declares a listener exists in the application.
The element defines:
