            <p>The Policy toolkit is a set of utility classes that
            will read in an xml file that describes a code-based security
            policy xml descriptor. The descriptor contains the same
            information as is present in the java.policy file but described
            in an xml file. This toolkit is also capable of validating a
            descriptor to make sure it is well formed and follows some basic
            semantic rules. Please see the <a href="sample.html">sample</a>
            descriptor for an example of the format that the Policy toolkit
            supports.</p>
